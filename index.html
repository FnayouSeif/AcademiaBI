<p>Business Intelligence Simulation For Academia is a project that targets students who are enrolled in Business Intelligence courses or professionals who want to have a practical idea about basic business intelligence. This whole package will include different interfaces and/or applications that will allow any user to do the following for example:</p>

<p>Create tables in a local/ internet based database (the data warehouse)
Design data models for the data warehouse
Develop ETL functions as stored procedures
Run ETL functions through a data integration application
Create reports from data stored in data warehouse
Test data using different methods
In other words, the package will try to cover the whole business intelligence systems implementation cycle using basic and easy to use applications and interfaces.</p>
